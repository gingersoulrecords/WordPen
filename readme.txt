Embed pens from CodePen without the 'edit' frame

== Description ==

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) is a 'playground for the front end web' where you can write public-facing HTML/CSS/JS demos, called pens. It's a fountain of inspiration for web designers and a useful resource for those learning to write, organize, and share front end code.

WordPen by [Ginger Soul Records](https://gingersoulrecords.com/) is an effort to bring the best of CodePen to WordPress, with minimal code work. Simply paste a CodePen URL, save your WordPen, and embed a shortcode in your layout.

HTML, CSS, and JS code will be editable, and all connected resources linked to the pen will be included with the shortcode.

Not all pens were designed to be featured with WordPen, so you may wish to start with background- and foreground-friendly pens, which are collected [here](http://codepen.io/gingersoulrecords/collections/public/).
